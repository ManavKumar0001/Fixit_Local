# FixIt Local – One-Stop Platform for Local Tech Services

Welcome to the official repository for FixIt Local — a project built to simplify how people in tier-2 and tier-3 cities access reliable tech services. Whether it's repairing a printer, getting help with your laptop, or hiring someone to build your website, FixIt Local aims to make the whole process smooth, trustworthy, and digital.

## Problem We're Solving

In many smaller cities, finding a trustworthy tech service provider is still a frustrating experience. Most people rely on word of mouth or visit random local shops, without knowing who’s reliable or what the actual cost should be. 

On the flip side, skilled local service providers often struggle to grow because they don’t have an online presence or a platform to manage their bookings and clients efficiently.

---

## Our Solution

FixIt Local is a web and mobile platform that bridges the gap between everyday users and skilled tech service providers. We’re building a system where users can book both online and offline services — from web development to hardware repairs — and vendors can grow their business with better visibility, smart tools, and organized operations.

## How We Plan to Monetize FixIt Local

While FixIt Local is designed to be helpful and community-focused, we’re also planning for long-term sustainability. Here’s our monetization approach:

1. **Commission per Booking**  
   A small percentage from each completed booking will be taken from the vendor side — only when they get real work.

2. **Vendor Subscription Plans**  
   Free plan with basic features, and optional paid plans with:
   - Higher search visibility
   - Access to analytics and dashboard insights
   - Priority support and booking preference

3. **Promoted Listings**  
   Vendors can choose to feature their services at the top of listings within their category or region for a fee.

4. **Lead Generation Bundles**  
   Verified customer leads can be purchased in bundles to help vendors grow more rapidly.

5. **Future Add-ons**  
   Additional services planned include:
   - Verified vendor badge via KYC
   - Instant payment settlements
   - SMS/WhatsApp appointment alerts
   - Rental tools and equipment support for technicians

Our goal is to offer real value to users and vendors while keeping the platform fair and affordable.
